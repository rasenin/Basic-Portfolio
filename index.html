                <p>
                    My name is Roman and I'm 21 years old. I'm currently studying Computer Science as an undergrad at UC
                    Davis.

                    As a first-generation immigrant from Ukraine, life wasn't easy from the get-go but my family taught
                    me
                    the
                    value of hard work and determination and I never took that for granted. As a kid I had my hobbies
                    and
                    pastimes, mostly music and sports. Technology was only starting to become widespread and for the
                    majority of
                    my childhood my family only had one computer. Nevertheless, that old hunk of silicon sitting there
                    in
                    our
                    living room perked my interest into technology.

                <p>
                    I always dreamed about someday learning how to create websites and applications, delving
                    into
                    the
                    details of what makes modern computing so ubiquitous and life-transforming. This portfolio is part
                    of
                    that
                    dream becoming reality and I'm super excited to now have a formal webpage I could call my very own.
