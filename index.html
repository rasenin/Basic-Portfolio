            My name is Roman and I'm 21 years old. I'm currently studying
            Computer Science as an undergrad at UC Davis.

            As a first-generation immigrant from Ukraine, life wasn't easy from
            the get-go but my family taught me the value of hard work and
            determination and I never took that for granted. As a kid I had my
            hobbies and pastimes, mostly music and sports. Technology was only
            starting to become widespread and for the majority of my childhood
            my family only had one computer. Nevertheless, that old hunk of
            silicon sitting there in our living room perked my interest into
            technology.

          <p>
            I always dreamed about someday learning how to create websites and
            applications, delving into the details of what makes modern
            computing so ubiquitous and life-transforming. This portfolio is
            part of that dream becoming reality and I'm super excited to now
            have a formal webpage I could call my very own.
