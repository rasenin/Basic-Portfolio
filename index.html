            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Roman and I'm 21 years old. I'm currently studying Computer Science as an undergrad at UC
                Davis.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a first-generation immigrant from Ukraine, life wasn't easy from the get-go but my family taught me
                the
                value of hard work and determination and I never took that for granted. As a kid I had my hobbies and
                pastimes, mostly music and sports. Technology was only starting to become widespread and for the
                majority of
                my childhood my family only had one computer. Nevertheless, that old hunk of silicon sitting there in
                our
                living room perked my interest into technology.

            </p>

            <p>
                I always dreamed about someday learning how to create websites and applications and just delving into
                the
                details of what makes modern computing so ubiquitous and life-transforming. This portfolio is part of
                that
                dream becoming reality and I'm super excited to now have a formal webpage I could call my very own.
