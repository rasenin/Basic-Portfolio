        <p>
          My name is Roman and I'm a fourth year undergraduate at UC Davis
          studying Computer Science. I enjoy coding and the thrill of solving
          complex problems with code.

        <p>
          My family and I are first generation immigrants from Ukraine and so
          we've had to build our way up from the bottom. My parents taught me
          the value of hard work and being grateful for the little things. I
          continue to live by their example and strive for success day in and
          day out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of my hobbies include singing and playing the piano and guitar. I
          also like board games such as chess and anything that
          stimulates the brain or requires planning and strategizing.
